                             There are two many statistics we present for the player, based on what they did over the course of the season.

                            We scale statistics to 'per 90 minutes' so that we can accurately assess how well a player 
                            does a certain action in a constained amount of time. 90 minutes is a length of a soccer match. 
                            
                            <br> All percentiles are derived using a subset of all available players. 
                            By defaul, you compare 'performance per 90 minutes' for players who played at least 1,000 minutes 
                            in the top 5 european leagues. 
                            
                            <br> Percentile gives you just one summary statistic, so feel free to select a variable of interest

                          Now that you saw what stats a player excells at, are you curious what other players do the same things 
                    just as good? Maybe you are a scount that wants to find a replacement for an aging star?

                    Uisng a set of best statistics, on the per 90 minutes scale, we calculate euclidian distance from each 
                    player to a player of interest. This distance is then scaled to 0-1 scale, for convinience.
                    
                    On this page you will see a number of similar players. By default, we include a vast range of ages, 
                    but you can limit it and focus on scouting young outstanding players. 
                    
                    You can also pick positions that we scout, by default all positions for a player of interest are selected.

                          Tables are fun and all, but how do these 10-15 players look compared to everyone in the comparison 
                         subset!?

                         Unfortunately, we can't make a plot with 15 axes, so we need to reduce the dimensions. Uisng PCA, we 
                         can achive this goal. A small summary table shows how much variation if contained within the first X
                         principal components. A rule of thumb is to have around 80% of original variation. 
                         <br> 
                         We can then use the first two principal components to make a scatter plot that, sort of, shows the 
                         spead of these high dimensional data, and where similar players are located when compared to the target
                         player, as well as all other players. 
                         
                         <br> What about the distibution of distances? I don't know honestly, after I made a plot I could not find a use for it.
