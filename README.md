# Product Title: Advanced player-level soccer data analysis

I will be working on the final project by myself. I decided to collect,
store, and analyze some advanced soccer statistics. The final product
will involve two major components: automatically refreshing data with
intermediate storage in AWS, and an interactive ShinyDashboard
application with player-level and team-level advanced statistics, in
large provided by Opta, and available for websraping on
[FBref.com](https://fbref.com/en/)
