                <li> The dahsboards provides a summary and some analytics of soccer player performance based on 
                over 80 variables, for 12 leagues, for data going back to the 2018, or 2017/2018 seasons! </li> 
                
                <li> The data is taken from FBref.com, a free to use soccer database and news website </li> 
                
                <li> FBref is a great source of data, providing both commonly used metrics, such as Expected Goals (xG) or 
                progressive carries, but also some very detailed statistics, such as the number of times a 
                player 'switches' the field, i.e. reverses the direction of the ball </li> 
                
                <li> All these stats can be used to accurately summarize players' profiles, and find similar players 
                in a pool of over 30,000 players. </li>

                      <li> Each player's 'per 90 minutes' statistics are used to find a percentile of a corresponding statistics. 
                          Higher percentile means player is more of an expert in a given category than most players. </li> 
                    
                      <li> Percentiles are found using a restricted pool of players. By default, you compare a player 
                            against other players who played at least 1,000 minutes in the top 5 European leagues. </li>
